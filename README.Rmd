A skeleton framework for setting up a site-file based project workflow using
the malariaverse, orderly2 and the cluster.

None of this code is meant to run, but as a guide for setting up a site file 
project. Consider the structure, code examples and comments when setting up for
your own use.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='600px', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("malaria_project_image.png")
```
